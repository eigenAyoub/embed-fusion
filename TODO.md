## MRL Vs Auto-encoder:

1. Generate Jina embeddings. [can't do it? flash attention issue, moo]
2. Train and Compare.


## bge-small --- e5-small, upscaled with [e5-mxbai]-1024 then [e5-mxbai]-768

## Simple auto-encoder approach:

* please normalize mxbai, any improvements?
* Re-do the experiments with the new trianing insights.

## Merge code, make it clear for everybody, improve CLI.

* Merge files (mapper // auto-encoder )
* Clean unwanted-stuff.
